# MultiHome 🏠

**Tagline:** Find. Rent. Manage. Live Better.

## 💡 Concept Idea

**MultiHome** is an e-commerce-style platform for real estate properties (homes, flats, rentals) — where multiple societies (multies) are listed, each having multiple homes or flats inside, connected to multi-owners, helpers, and service providers.

Essentially, it’s a **“Real Estate + Home Services + Rental Management”** system :—

- Users browse listings (like products)
- They can book, rent, or request services
- Payments flow through the platform

This falls into the **Property E-commerce** category — a fast-growing market.

## 🌇 How It Works (Flow Example)

### 1️⃣ Multies (Buildings or Societies)

- Each multi has a profile (location, amenities, flats available, helpers registered)
- Each multi acts like a category in an e-commerce store

### 2️⃣ Homes / Flats

- Each flat is like a product — listed with details: rent, size, owner, photos, availability
- Users can book visits, rent, or buy directly through the platform

### 3️⃣ Multi-Owners

- Each flat can have an owner profile to manage properties, set rent, upload images, or track payments

### 4️⃣ Helpers (Home Service Providers)

- Helpers (electricians, cleaners, plumbers) register per multi
- Residents can hire them instantly (like Blinkit’s “Instant Help” model)

### 5️⃣ Tenants / Renters

- Search flats by location, amenities, price, and availability
- Book or rent homes online and manage rent payments

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (for flexible nested data: Multi → Flats → Users)
- **Auth:** Firebase / JWT
- **Payments:** Razorpay / Stripe
